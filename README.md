# Bank-Churn-Prediction-SVM-GridSearch

## Objective
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using various machine learning techniques. The techniques include data encoding, feature scaling, handling imbalanced data, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. 

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook demonstrating data preprocessing, feature scaling, handling imbalanced data using SMOTE, training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and tuning hyperparameters with Grid Search.

## Data Source
The dataset used is available at: [Bank Churn Modelling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/main/Bank%20Churn%20Modelling.csv)
